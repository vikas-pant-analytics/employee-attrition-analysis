Executive Summary

The goal of this project was to analyze employee attrition within the company, identify the key areas driving turnover, and propose data-driven solutions to reduce future attrition risk.

The analysis followed a structured pipeline. Raw employee data was cleaned and transformed in Excel to create a feature-ready dataset. Key attrition-related variables were identified and categorized into analytical segments. A relational data model was then designed and implemented in SQL, where the dataset was imported for investigation.

Using SQL analysis, multiple hypotheses were tested to identify root causes of attrition. These findings were validated through segmentation and risk profiling, leading to evidence-based insights and final recommendations.

Key findings show that employees who leave earn significantly lower salaries, experience lower satisfaction, and tend to exit during early tenure stages. Attrition risk is heavily concentrated in the Research & Development department.

Recommended actions include strengthening early-career support and training programs, improving satisfaction through workload balance and management culture, and prioritizing targeted intervention in R&D. Strategic compensation adjustments should be focused on high-risk segments rather than applied broadly.
